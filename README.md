Creative Portion:
For our creative portion, we made a filter for favorites and a search bar for events. For the favorites, we made it so that it is a feature selectable upon event creation and edit. It is also differentiable through color when clicking show fav. For the search bar, we can use it to search for the title of the event and show only those that are searched. Also, we made a modal for doing the editing / deleting process of the events but not sure if that counts towards the creative portion.
